# Edwin's Portfolio

This is my portfolio, it contains links to my work, my github, resume, social media, an about me section, and my contact information. I created this page so that potential employers can get to know a little about my interests and ensure that I have the skills and personality to enhance their web development team. This page will be changing as i learn more skills and have more experience to add to the content. This page can be used to contact me for potential job interest or networking.
